# claude-mnemo

Persistent memory for Claude Code sessions: an episodic layer of recorded turns and
a semantic layer of task containers, maintained by the agents that do the work.
Vocabulary pinned by the 2026-08-17 segment redesign and the 2026-08-19
edge-ownership redesign (ADR-0001…0008).

## Language

### Memory model

**Turn note**:
The episodic record of one conversation turn: its conclusion, the expansion of that
conclusion, and any lesson.
_Avoid_: extraction, summary

**Segment**:
The long-lived semantic container for one task lane, accumulating across sessions.
Addressed by `E<n>`.
_Avoid_: arc (for this concept)

**Topic** — _retired_:
The segment-grouping registry. Two mechanisms were recording one kind of
information — a mechanism-level synonym split — so its role collapsed into tags:
the theme a topic named is just a tag on the segment.

**Arc** (also **episode**):
One bounded span of a task's activity inside a segment's history.
_Avoid_: segment (for this concept)

**Session**:
The episodic container for one conversation. Carries no semantic memory.
_Avoid_: task (a session is a slice of one or more tasks)

**Summary layer**:
The segment fields written for outsiders browsing the task.

**Working State**:
The segment fields a resuming session needs to continue the task.
_Avoid_: working set (that's the attached segments), summary

**Attachment (挂靠)**:
A session's reference to a segment as loaded working memory. Not a lifecycle object.
_Avoid_: binding, subscription

**Membership**:
A turn's belonging to a segment, decided by the turn's content.
_Avoid_: attachment (sessions attach; turns are members)

**Homeless turn (无归属)**:
A turn belonging to no segment. Legal — noise stays out of the semantic layer.

**Roster (花名册)**:
The injected, paginated list of live segments (title and tags, most recently
active first) that makes attachment and creation read-before-write.

**Proposal**:
Settlement's text-only suggestion that homeless turns form a new segment. Never a
database object, never auto-adopted.

### Judging

**Settlement**:
The asynchronous re-check pass over a finished window of turns: corrects the four
structured fields (type, tags, membership, edges) against the Memory Rubric, keeps
the session narrative, and proposes segments for homeless turns. Never a first
writer; a window with nothing to correct completes empty-handed.

**Election (差额选举)** — _retired_:
The competitive three-tier ranking settlement once ran. Machinery deleted
(edge-ownership redesign); old grades stay stored and readable, old-era turns exit
milestone rendering.
_Avoid_: grading, scoring (the legacy absolute 0–4 semantics)

**ops (type word)**:
Delivery (release, commit, publishing a spec or tickets) plus operations (health
probes, restarts, data repair). Pure spec transcription is ops; carrying a new
ruling too makes it design+ops.

**Citation floor**:
The rule that a summary-layer claim exists only with a turn citation.

**Era**:
A semantics boundary in stored data; reads never mix the two sides.

### Write gate

**Read grant (读授权)**:
A writer's license to write an entity, earned by that entity's content actually
being rendered to it — a recall/timeline call, or an injected block that carries
the content. A pointer line naming an entity is not a render of it.
Entity-level: one appearance licenses every field.
_Avoid_: lock (nothing is held; it's a license check at write time)

**Complete read (完整读)**:
A render that delivered one field untruncated. Writing a field whole over content
ANOTHER writer put there requires one; editing a matched span inside it never
does, and neither does an empty field or content you wrote yourself — the
difference between the two write modes is this read requirement, nothing else.
Which read delivers a field whole is surface-specific: a bigger `turn` cap for a
turn field, a bigger `pageBudget` for a segment card's rows, and a
metadata-selecting recall for a turn's type/tags (a plain recall shows neither).

**Stale (失效)**:
A field another writer touched after the grant; writing it again requires a fresh
read, in either write mode. Error messages distinguish stale from never-granted.

**Writer (写者)**:
The identity a write is attributed to — the caller session for agents, its own
identity for settlement. A field whose last writer is the caller is always
writable (writing is reading).

### Addressing

**Turn address (`S<n>/T<m>`)**:
The only legal citation form for a turn — stable, render-independent.

**Ordinal T (`E31/T3`)**:
A turn's position in a segment's chronological render. Selection-only: attaching an
earlier turn later shifts every ordinal after it.
_Avoid_: citing an ordinal

### Tools

**note**:
The main agent's episodic write surface (记录): turn notes. The session's title and
content belong to settlement.

**remember**:
The main agent's semantic write surface (记住): segment creation, attachment, and
field maintenance.
_Avoid_: the retired 0.x remember (merged into note)

**Write mode (write/edit)**:
The one vocabulary both write surfaces share. `write` replaces a field whole;
`edit` swaps an exactly-matched span inside it, rejecting a miss or an ambiguous
match rather than guessing.
_Avoid_: overwrite, append, replace (the two retired vocabularies it replaces)

**Tag**:
A noun naming a thing — the project first, then subsystems or artifacts. Carries
the theme the retired topic registry once held. Activities belong to `type`,
never to tags.
_Avoid_: activity-suffixed hybrids (`segment-design`)
